# IEEE Ottawa Section Rep

## Who am I?
Hello, I appreciate the time you have taken out from your busy day to read this. My name is Rafid; I am a third-year software engineering student at Carleton University.

I've been volunteering for IEEE Carleton, IEEE SPAC, and cuHacking since my first year back in September 2017. I love to watch cricket, I play the acoustic guitar, I love to code new side projects, I follow tech youtube channels, and I'm currently working on a fiction novel that I will be publishing next year! I'm also going to be working for 8+ months at General Dynamics Mission-Systems Canada as a co-op software engineer.

## Vision for IEEE Ottawa Section
IEEE has played a pivotal role in molding my leadership and organization skills today. I would love to help expand the IEEE Ottawa Section's presence within the tech community in Ottawa. The section plays a critical role in the municipal level organizing all sorts of corporate lunch and learns as well as seminars. My duty will be to provide representation and communication between the student branches.


Some of the things I want to help change sturcturally at the IEEE Ottawa Section, is organization. I would like to create an IEEE Ottawa Section Student Branch Rep Gmail account that hosts all the interbranch events in one folder on the Google Drive. This will also contain a list of all the companies that can be patrons for these events (since SPAC and Wine and Cheese requires the same contacts), and will be updated by their committees respective patronage leads.

I will also like to add a new award called the "Interbranch Event Award" to the committee. As SPAC Lead last year, many of the team members on the committee felt not as appreciated as they should be from the section and student branches. The interbranch events such as IEEE SPAC and IEEE Wine and Cheese are so big, yet there is a lack of appreciation for them. These events now have their own separate committees and individuals that are not part of the student branch (since they have grown so large).

As well as awards, I notice there are more high school scholarships as well. I will be willing to go talk to various high schools and give virtual presentations about IEEE and motivate them to join the student branches.

Moreover, I am a huge advocate of documentation. I am willing to make the student branch rep a fully documented and fleshed out role with timelines and guidelines. This will be useful for future student branch reps down the line.

The last thing I would love to do is establish more relationship virtual events with the student branches. I would like to inform them of the scholarships that are present of the IEEE Canadian Foundation (since I am a Member on the board) as well as some of the fun events and workshops the section hosts. I will also make sure all the communication is constant between student branches.
